# Introduction

Hello there!

I'm **Smit Lunagariya**. I have done my bachelor's and master's in **Mathematics and Computing Engineering** from the [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU)](https://iitbhu.ac.in/).

During my time in [Google Summer
of Code 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/4549744795320320), I embarked on an
exhilarating journey with [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), a symbolic computation library in Python.
Through my blog posts, I've shared insights into the project that I
experienced during this transformative period.

Check out all the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASmit-create+is%3Aclosed) on the SymPy repo.
